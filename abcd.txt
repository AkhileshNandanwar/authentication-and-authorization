Stage 2: Exploiting the Blob Deserialization Handler

The second critical component is the $B handler reference ($B1337)

In React’s Flight protocol, the $B prefix indicates a Blob reference

When React processes a Blob reference, it calls a function that internally uses:
response._formData.get(response._prefix + id)

Here’s where the exploitation becomes elegant:

We’ve polluted the _response object with our malicious properties

When the Blob handler executes:
response._formData.get(response._prefix + id)

It actually executes:
Function("process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('xcalc');1337")

Stage 3: Achieving Code Execution

The payload process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('xcalc') demonstrates the power of this exploit

We’re using Node.js’s module system to:

Access process.mainModule (the main module being executed)

Use its require method to load the child_process module

Call execSync to execute an operating system command

In this case:

Launching the calculator application (xcalc) as proof of exploitation

This could easily be modified to:

Establish a reverse shell

Exfiltrate environment variables containing secrets
React2Shell is a security vulnerability in React Server Components where unsafe handling of React Flight data allows attackers to inject malicious payloads.
Due to improper validation of special symbols like $, $B, and $S, React may trust and execute attacker-controlled data.
This can lead to remote code execution (RCE).
As a result, attackers can run system commands, read files, and fully compromise the server.

Read sensitive files

Perform any operation the Node.js process has permissions to execute 

The severity score for React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) is 10.0, which is the maximum possible on the CVSS scale, indicating a critical severity level. This reflects the fact that the vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution on affected servers and has a wide impact on React Server Components and frameworks like Next.js
